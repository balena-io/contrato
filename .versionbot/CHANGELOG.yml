    - subject: Allow additional properties for type generation
      hash: 4b9a363a3a93da0174f8a2235df6b912f086b4dc
      body: |
        It seems that openapi-typescript changed the default behavior for type
        generation with regards of additional properties between 3.2.x and
        3.4.x. This would cause builds to fail due to type checking now that we
        removed package-lock.json. This passes the option to the openapi
        function to maintain compatibility.

      body: |
        Fixes a bug in partial resolution where files were being read using
        memfs module instead of the actual filesystem. This would cause template
        rendering to fail.

        The "not" operator takes an array of contracts as an argument (as all
        the other operators).

        The requirements are unfulfilled if at least one of the contracts
        declared in the "not" array exists in the context.

                This is a hack, and should be reverted once we get to the bottom of it.

                It will impact performance, but right now there are things that should

                be filtered and are not, so lets get this merged for security purposes.

                Hopefully this library will be re-written soon.

        Handlebars supports very basic if condition checking, but it only checks
        for

        existence of a field. There are times when we want to combine conditions in order

        to generate something as part of a blueprint, without defining a completely separate

        blueprint for it (like generating network config schema if a dt has a wifi chip or

        a usb port to which we can connect a dongle).

      body: |-
        This adds a sequence method to Blueprints, which will build a path
        to the most advanced version of the combosition of the blueprint.
        The steps in the path will work in a way that all requirements of
        each contract are satisfied at all time and each step will only
        increment the version of one component.
        This is only true for non infinite components atm, components that
        are added to the result of the blueprint by an infinite selector, will
        just be filled up with whatever is available, so that path algorithm
        only operates on the finite selectors.
        This also add semver range version matching for requirements and
        selectors.

        The `version` field in selectors can now hold the `latest`
        keyword, which will mean, that the selector will only collect
        the latest X versions of the component. X is the minimum of the
        cardinality of the selector and the available contracts.
