 * @description
 * A contract might declare a set of variants of itself as a way
 * to express many different related contracts that share a large
 * set of properties in a single contract to avoid duplication.
 *
 * Before this type of contract can be used, you need to build
 * the variants, and get a list of the final contracts.
 *
 * @param {Object} contract - contract
 * @returns {Object[]} contracts
 *
 * @example
 * const contracts = variants.build({
 *   type: 'distro',
 *   name: 'Debian',
 *   slug: 'debian',
 *   variants: [
 *     {
 *       version: 'wheezy'
 *     },
 *     {
 *       version: 'jessie'
 *     }
 *   ]
